<h4>*This is the refactored version of the RLI 6mans Discord bot*</h4>
<p>It works the exact same as the master version, unfortunately while it worked on my local PC, it did not work on the server I used to host the bot, and so I had to give up on this version to focus on other projects</p>

<h2>RLI-6mans</h2>
<h3>A discord bot for the RL Ireland server</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This bot takes a queue of 6 people and makes two teams of 3.</li>
  <li>Bot will allow players to choose if they want random or captained teams</li>
  <li>If captained teams picked, bot will pick captains based on leaderboard positions</li>
  <li>Players report who won, and the bot keeps track of this through txt files.</li>
  <li>This bot is intended to have multiple tiers going at once. (Casual, Championship, Premier, Elite).</li>
  <li>For the bot to work properly there must be txt files for each of the tiers in the same folder as the bot code itself.</li>
  <li>The names of these txt files need to be "casual_wins.txt", "casual_games_played.txt" etc.</li>
  <li>Players can check their stats and the full leaderboard through more bot commands</li>
</ul>
