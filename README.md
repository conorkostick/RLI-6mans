<h2>RLI-6mans</h2>
<h3>A discord bot for the RL Ireland server</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This bot takes a queue of 6 people and makes two teams of 3.</li>

  <li>For the bot to work properly there must be txt files for each of the tiers in the same folder as the bot code itself.</li>
  <li>The names of these txt files need to be "casual_wins.txt", "casual_games_played.txt" etc.</li>
  <li>Players can check their stats and the full leaderboard through more bot commands</li>
