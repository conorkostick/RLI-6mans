# RLI-6mans
A discord bot for the RL Ireland server

This bot takes a queue of 6 people and makes 2 teams of 3.
Players report who won, and the bot keeps track of this
This bot is intended to have multiple tiers going at once. (Casual, Junior A, Intermediate, Senior)
For the bot to work properly there must be txt files for each of the tiers in the same folder as the bot code itself.
The names of these txt files need to be "casual_wins.txt", "casual_games_played.txt" etc.
